## Overview

This is my third front-end development study project - a fully interactive Pokédex that showcases Pokémon up through the Black & White generation. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project leverages the PokéAPI to bring the world of Pokémon to life in your browser.

## Features

- **649 Pokémons**: Displays detailed information for the first several generations of Pokémon
- **Type-Based Styling**: Each Pokémon card is color-coded based on its primary type
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Clean UI**: Minimalist design focused on showcasing the Pokémon

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Fetch API for data retrieval
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for Pokémon data

## What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
- Working with external APIs
- Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)
- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- CSS styling and animations
- Responsive web design principles

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to start exploring the Pokédex:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NatanMoura77/Pokedex-List.git
cd pokedex-list
```

No build process or dependencies required!

## Future Enhancements

I'm planning to add these features in the future:
- Search functionality
- Filtering by type
- Detailed view for each Pokémon
- Evolution chains
